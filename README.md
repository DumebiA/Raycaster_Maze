# 3D Raycasting Game

## Introduction
Welcome to our 3D Raycasting Game project! Inspired by classic first-person shooter games, we embarked on this journey to create an immersive gaming experience using raycasting technology. Our goal was to push the boundaries of what we could achieve with C and SDL2, while also delving into the world of game development.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for this project came from our shared love for retro gaming and a desire to understand the underlying mechanics of classic games like Wolfenstein 3D. We wanted to challenge ourselves by building something from scratch, learning about raycasting techniques, and experiencing the joy of creating a game from the ground up.

## Technical Challenge
One of the most daunting technical challenges we faced was implementing the raycasting algorithm itself. Understanding how to cast rays from the player's viewpoint, detect collisions with walls, and render the environment dynamically was a complex task. We spent countless hours studying tutorials, experimenting with different approaches, and debugging issues to refine our implementation.

### Raycasting Algorithm
The raycasting algorithm works by casting rays from the player's viewpoint to determine the distance to walls in the environment. By calculating the intersection points between these rays and the walls, we can create the illusion of a 3D world. This process involves intricate mathematical calculations, including trigonometric functions and vector operations.

## Struggles and Growth
Throughout the development process, we encountered numerous challenges and setbacks. From segmentation faults to rendering glitches, each obstacle tested our problem-solving skills and perseverance. However, with determination and collaboration, we overcame these hurdles and gained valuable insights into the intricacies of game programming.

## Next Steps
As we reflect on our journey, we envision several areas for improvement and expansion in future iterations of the project:
- Enhancing graphics and visual effects to create a more polished gaming experience.
- Implementing additional gameplay features such as enemy AI, weapon mechanics, and interactive objects.
- Optimizing performance to ensure smooth gameplay on a variety of hardware configurations.

## Timeline and Collaboration
This project was a labor of love spanning several weeks of intense development and collaboration. Despite the challenges, we supported each other, shared knowledge, and celebrated our victories along the way. Our teamwork and dedication were instrumental in bringing this project to life.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the 3D Raycasting Game project represents our passion for game development, our commitment to continuous learning, and our willingness to tackle complex technical challenges head-on. We are proud of what we have accomplished and excited to see where this journey takes us next.

ðŸš€ Let's embark on this adventure together!
